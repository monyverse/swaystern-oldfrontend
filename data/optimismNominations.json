We've devised a way to build an index of \"every appearance of every address as it appears anywhere on the Ethereum mainnet.\" Furthermore, we've figured out how to share that index to end users in a fair and equitable way where each user carries his/her own burden and shares that burden with others through IPFS. This allows us to create a local-first desktop application that can do 18-decimal place, every-14-second, fully-reconciled accounting on any address.

Many of these ideas have influenced how rollups communicate to each other and the roadmap for eth2.\n\nAdditionally, they developed the fastest EVM interpreter to date, evmone, a just-in-time compiler for EVM, and a fast, blockchain-focused WASM interpreter named Fizzy.\n\nMore recently, they have created a road map to evolve the EVM into a safer, more powerful platform. A few of the proposals in this suite:\n\n* EOF -- The Ethereum Object Format will allow backwards incompatible changes into the EVM. The potential of this is unlimited, but a few of their initial proposals will allow improved code analysis and reduce execution time.\n* EVM384 -- Native bignum operations that can be used to implement cryptographic primitives efficiently, without having to wait for a precompile.\n* Improved bounds on various aspects of the EVM to improve network safety and simplify some logic that relies on unbounded values.\n\nIpsilon has been a great contributor to the ecosystem for many years. A few hundred words can't account for all the ideas they've had or reviewed, nor the code they've written or reviewed. It's probably safe to say that some member of the team has thoroughly reviewed every EVM change since Spurious Dragon.\n\nI think they are as deserving as anyone to receive a retroPGF.",

We shipped to the Ethereum Rinkeby test network [3]. \n\nLeapDAO members actively participated in the Plasma \"Implementer Calls\" [4, 15] and contributed meaningfully with proposals to the ethresear.ch online forum [5, 6]. \n\nWe, the underwriters, believe that particularly the work around solEVM and LeapDAO founder Johann's post on \"_Why Smart Contracts are NOT feasible on Plasma_\" [6] deserve more recognition as they've informed the future work on Optimism's OVM and rollups [7].\n\nWhile developing Plasma, LeapDAO members engaged in numerous other meaningful activites. We organized a quadratic voting session (\"popup democracy\") at the Volt Deutschland party congress [8]. At cccamp and ETH Berlin Zwei, we deployed \"Planet A\" - a \"serious social game\"[9, 10] to educate on the adverserial effects of the tragedy of the commons.\n\nLeapDAO's .org domain is currently down. Shit happens. We're trying to fix it. But all LeapDAO contributions and token equity have been recorded by the LeapDAO treasury [11]. Through this record, we believe that LeapDAO is uniquely setup to receive retroactive funding by e.g. airdropping rewards to all LEAP token holders [12].\n\nLeapDAO members have since then moved onto other projects in the Ethereum space. 0xhabitat.org is improving governance and runs on a domain-specific rollup called NutBerry [13]. Strudel.finance's aim was to limit Bitcoin's incumbency and CO2 emissions. rugpullindex.com improves AMM staking safety. Social Dist0rtion Protocol has renamed themselves to \"*Social Distancing* Protocol\". EthereumMachineOracle is a spiritual successor of solEVM [14]. Whiterabbit.one aims to decentralize movie streaming and reduce piracy the gentle way. And sushi is delicious, especially when it *flow*s.\n\nMore than anything, with this application, we, the ones that haven't managed to deploy our work onto the Ethereum mainnet, seek to find attribution and recognition for the countless hours and sleepless nights spent on contributing to open source and the Ethereum ecosystem. Hence, we'd love to get retroactive funding for our work.\n\nSigned,\nThe LeapDAO team\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YMupQQ22ky\n\n### References\n\n- 1: https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/14849/orgnav/roles/10883348\n- 2: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/05e1570c7fac1a097efaae4f7aab4426be3ca2b3/fundingProposals/Template%20-%20Funding%20Proposal.md\n- 3: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/master/playbook/operations/testnet/README.md#contracts\n- 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTKCmYB6ntA\n- 5: https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-leap-a-state-enabled-computing-model-for-plasma/3539\n- 6: https://ethresear.ch/t/why-smart-contracts-are-not-feasible-on-plasma/2598\n- 7: https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer\n- 8: https://twitter.com/leapdao/status/1169921680317341696?s=20\n- 9: https://www.dist0rtion.com/2019/09/18/planet-a-ccc-ethberlin-recap/\n- 10: https://medium.com/ethberlin/introducing-planet-a-the-tragedy-of-the-co%E2%82%82mmons-90e35c229475\n- 11: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SvvfFPNFXntJTOWhHn_-Qj-11IM3qUWosjn6w5aXMlo/edit\n- 12: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78230e69d6e6449db1e11904e0bd81c018454d7a\n- 13: https://ethresear.ch/t/nutberry-smart-contracts-on-layer-2/6126\n- 14: https://github.com/leapdao/EthereumMachineOracle/\n- 15: https://plasma.io/plasma-contracts.html",

It was one of the earliest DApps on Ethereum to implement a Scaling solution. We actually Bridged to Ethereum Several projects evolved off of this platform, including DAppNode, BrightID, and Commons Stack. https://trace.giveth.io\n \n2018-now Camp Decentral \nWe run Camp Decentral: a Burning Man camp that holds a crypto conference at burning man every year. 80+ hours of talks focused on the revolutionary aspects of crypto... no number go up talk allowed\n\n2018-now Giveth Home \nWe have a crypto house in Barcelona open to the blockchain4good community its a sort of hacker pad... 100s of crypto people have stayed there, and no one has ever had to pay. https://trace.giveth.io/campaign/giveth-house\n\n2018-2020 OpenSourceBlockExplorersNOW!\nWe helped to unite the various efforts being made to decentralized Ethereum infrastructure. Etherscan is great, but was a closed source central point of failure... until Blockscout emerged. When that happened this effort became DecentralizedDataNOW! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Artm1rmCWE5qYEOTaaPRl4fD5ORXFty\n\n2018-now Rinkeby & xDai Validator\nWe were one of the original 4 xDai Validators to initialize the network with no reward for many years but this public good work has paid off now, as doing good things tends to work out in crypto! We have been part of the Rinkeby Clique since early 2020. We also Validate for the public goods focused projects: IDchain and Trustlines.  \n\n2020-now Giveth.io, the New Giveth DApp\nWe built a simpler donation application that is intended to make it easy for non-profits to start collecting crypto donations in under 10 minutes with no prior knowledge. With Gitcoin funding open source, we are focusing squarely on charities and have big plans to help non-profits take full advantage of the web3 space. https://giveth.io\n\nAnd these are just the highlights...

More on that later.\n\nAround the same time, @jbaylina witnessed the Spanish government censoring websites about a Catalan Independence Referendum - They could do it, and they did it! \n\n\nSurely there was a better way to not be at the mercy of the ones with power?\n\nThe breeding ground for @dappnode was at the perfect temperature and this is the brew that was in the 3 founder's heads:\n- Decentralized systems can provide people direct access to information and value transfer. \n\nIt's like connecting directly to The Matrix vs. using an endpoint controlled by the machines in one of the vats. \n\n\n- @IPFS  websites + @ensdomains and you have decentralized, uncensorable web hosting.\n\n- Plus all the advantages of decentralized value transmission systems (crypto), new organization models (DAOs), etc. \n\nThe catch? People need to *run nodes* to \"connect directly\" instead of via a centralizing party. \n\nLet me pause here and say that public endpoints are ✨  our saviours ✨  of course but going to the 🐈  cat cafe and owning a cat 🐱 have different rewards and responsibilities.\n\nSo: Why are people not running nodes?\n1. Needs certain technical knowledge (CLI might seem bread and butter to you, but UIs still rule the world)\n2. Needs dedicated hardware that runs 24/7 (getting out of sync and sync again is a pain, trust me)\n\n\nSo DAppNode was conceived as a way to help ANYONE, regardless of their technical level, be able to OWN their own access to the web3 to create a new, uncensorable infrastructure layer for a new internet. \n\n\n🤑  Free Open Source Software\n✨  Easy to use UI\n🍹   no maintenance (auto-updates)\n🪐  Fully built with decentralized tech (no central servers, or only opt-in services)\n🛠️  SDK for anyone to build on it\n\n\nFor the user, it gives them independence, self-sovereignty. And for the network, it has the added benefit to make it more resilient, by increasing the number of nodes in different setups, countries, ISPs, hardware... you name it.\n\nFor that we got a grant from the @ethereum foundation and @AragonProject - which kickstarted the project. \n\nSince then we've been helping people run nodes, eth2 validators, decentralized storage and websites and helping people OWN their web3 and provide friends and family with access to a new world. \n\nHow many people? That's a good question: we don't know and we don't want to know. We collect NO METRICS and have NO WAY TO KNOW who runs DAppNode. We sell plug-and-play DAppNode boxes, but we don't know how many people are running the software themselves in their own machine. \n\nNeedless to say, this is a no-go for traditional investors 😅 \n\nSo, to sum up: we're building a decentralized infrastructure layer for web3. We make Ethereum more resilient, increasing the amount of decentralized nodes. We empower people to have direct access to web3. We give tools to the home staker.\n#Infrastructure is a #PublicGood.",

    "rationale": "Amy Finance is born to be a Layer 2 based & LP-friendly Lending Protocol. We have first built on Arbitrum and we believe that deploying on Optimism is a must way for us to achieve a successful lending protocol in L2 ecosystem. We have achieved great performance after our mainnet launch and it’s just the beginning for us. Amy is a fair launch project without a presale and private investor. It will be great if we could receive the grant from Optimism and we’ll have more resources to focus on our product and bring more convenience for Optimism users. \n\nAs a community-driven project, Amy Finance helps users to earn safe and high yields. Users are going to enjoy higher capital efficiency on Amy. By staking assets into the Assembly pool, each LP/Staker will receive the interests generated from lending and leverage trading without any loss. Moreover, users can borrow assets from the pool and conduct margin trading in one app. The transaction fee will be extremely low owing to the L2 native design. The design of Amy Finance can lift the revenue and maintain the same level of fund security as the classic lending protocols do.\n\nAmy Finance has three major parts: Lending, Margin trading and IQ mining. Users are able to enjoy high efficiency and Cex-like trading experiences on Amy Finance. As the main component of Amy Finance, Assembly Pool supplies assets for both margin trading and borrowing purposes, maximizing the utilization of assets for pool contributors. Users who stake assets into Assembly Pool will earn interest generated through margin trading and lending as well as newly minted $AMY token, with zero impermanent loss. \n\nMargin trading on Amy Finance is like using Lego blocks to build on other decentralized exchanges and brokers. Sourcing depth from other L2 exchanges, together with the execution speed of Layer2, Amy Finance offers centralized exchange-like trading experiences for any traders.\n\nUnlike other platforms that use liquidity mining to incentivize early adopters, Amy Finance follows a different path: using NFT for AMY Token Mining to attract early adopters and gamifying mining to make it more fun and enjoyable. Specifically, Amy Finance has issued Golden Cat NFT and IQ mining to gamify users’ mining and diversify their interest.The cats on Amy Finance possess different levels of IQ which are mostly related to their mining power. Amy Finance is more like a proof-of-IQ system where IQ mostly contributes to users’ yields.",
